# DWNO Return to the Title Screen Mod
This mod replaces the "Quit" Game function in the Digivice with a function to return to the Title Screen instead.
In addition it also skips the waiting time at the Splash Screen and removes the Logos and Opening Movie.
Given the nature of how the title scene is structured, at present there is no way to prevent it being loaded at just one point.
